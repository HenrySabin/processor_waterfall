# Algorand Smart Contract Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current mock Algorand integration into a fully functional blockchain-based payment processor priority management system.

## Phase 1: Core SDK Integration (2-3 days)
### 1.1 Import and Initialize Algorand SDK
- Add actual algosdk imports to AlgorandClient.ts
- Create real Algod client instances using environment configuration
- Implement connection testing with Algorand networks (testnet/mainnet)
- Replace mock mode detection with actual network connectivity checks

### 1.2 Basic Network Operations
- Implement getNodeStatus() to verify blockchain connectivity
- Add network health checking with real node responses
- Create proper error handling for network failures
- Test connectivity across different Algorand networks

## Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (3-4 days)
### 2.1 Contract Design and Development
- Design smart contract schema for processor priority management
- Implement contract methods:
  - Store processor configurations (id, name, priority, enabled status)
  - Read processor priorities and status
  - Update processor priorities with validation
  - Query processor success rates and metrics

### 2.2 Contract Deployment
- Set up deployment scripts for testnet and mainnet
- Configure environment variables with real contract IDs
- Test contract deployment and basic operations
- Document contract addresses and network configurations

## Phase 3: Transaction Implementation (2-3 days)
### 3.1 Account and Key Management
- Implement secure private key handling for transactions
- Set up account configuration for contract interactions
- Add transaction signing capabilities
- Handle Algorand transaction fees and confirmation

### 3.2 Contract Interaction Methods
- Replace getProcessorPriorities() with real contract state reads
- Implement updateProcessorPriorities() with actual transaction submission
- Add transaction confirmation and error handling
- Implement retry logic for failed transactions

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing (2-3 days)
### 4.1 Backend Integration
- Update payment processor to use real contract data
- Modify health checks to use actual blockchain status
- Remove all mock data dependencies
- Test waterfall routing with blockchain-managed priorities

### 4.2 Frontend Updates
- Update smart contract status display with real connection data
- Show actual contract addresses and network information
- Display real transaction hashes and confirmation status
- Add blockchain transaction history view

## Phase 5: Production Readiness (1-2 days)
### 5.1 Security and Performance
- Implement proper secret management for private keys
- Add transaction batching for efficiency
- Optimize contract calls to reduce network costs
- Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring

### 5.2 Documentation and Deployment
- Update environment variable documentation
- Create deployment guides for different networks
- Add troubleshooting guides for common blockchain issues
- Test full system with real Algorand transactions

## Required Environment Variables
```
ALGORAND_SERVER=https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud (or mainnet)
ALGORAND_TOKEN=<optional-token>
ALGORAND_PORT=443
ALGORAND_APP_ID=<deployed-contract-id>
ALGORAND_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-encoded-private-key>
ALGORAND_NETWORK=testnet (or mainnet)
```

## Success Criteria
✅ Real blockchain transactions for processor priority updates
✅ Contract state accurately reflects payment processor configurations
✅ Dashboard shows live blockchain connection status
✅ System operates without any mock data
✅ Proper error handling for network and transaction failures
✅ Security best practices for key management

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Network Costs**: Use testnet for development, optimize transaction frequency
- **Key Security**: Implement proper secret management, never hardcode keys
- **Network Reliability**: Add retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- **Contract Bugs**: Thorough testing before mainnet deployment

## Estimated Timeline: 10-15 days
This timeline assumes one developer working full-time with Algorand blockchain experience.
